## Introduction

Shock absorbers are critical components in mechanical systems, particularly in automotive suspensions, to absorb and dampen shock impulses. 
This project models and analyzes a spring-type shock absorber to evaluate its structural and dynamic performance under various loading conditions.

## Objectives

- To model a spring-type shock absorber in ANSYS.
- To perform equivalent stress analysis.
- To calculate total deformation under applied loads.
- To conduct modal analysis to find natural frequencies and mode shapes.
- To analyze the shock absorberâ€™s response to random vibrations using PSD displacement.



## Software and Tools

ANSYS Workbench: For modeling, meshing, and analysis.


## Methodology

### 1. Geometry and Meshing
- Import the shock absorber geometry into ANSYS.
- Create a fine mesh to capture detailed stress distributions and deformations.

### 2. Equivalent Stress Analysis
- Apply appropriate boundary conditions and loads.
- Solve for equivalent (von Mises) stress.
- Post-process and visualize the stress distribution.

### 3. Total Deformation Analysis
- Use the same setup as the stress analysis.
- Solve for total deformation under applied loads.
- Visualize the deformation across the shock absorber.

### 4. Modal Analysis
- Define the material properties and boundary conditions.
- Extract natural frequencies and mode shapes.
- Visualize the mode shapes for the first few natural frequencies.

### 5. Random Vibration Analysis using PSD
- Define the PSD displacement input.
- Perform a random vibration analysis to determine the response.
- Post-process the results to visualize the shock absorber's response.

## Results

The detailed results of the analysis are available in the attached ANSYS files

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of ANSYS for comprehensive FEA of a spring-type shock absorber. The analyses provide insights into the stress distribution, deformation patterns, natural frequencies, and response to random vibrations, which are crucial for designing robust and efficient shock absorbers.
